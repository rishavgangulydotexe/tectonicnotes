# Plate Tectonics
## 1.1 Plate tectonics Theory
### Key points:
- Plate tectonics theory explains how forces working within the Earth's interior drive tectonic plates movement globally
- The internal structure of the Earth consists of the core, mantle and crust.
- It is hypothesised that convection currents within the hot softened mantle blow the crust drive tectonic plate movement
- Another hypothesis focuses on how slab-full force also drives tectonic plate movements as a subducting oceanic plate drags the rest of the plate into the mantle due to gravity
### Content Concepts:
- Lithosphere
	- The crust and the uppermost solid part of the mantle (solid mantle)
- Tectonic plates
	- Pieces of rock that make up the lithosphere. They can contain continental and/or oceanic crust
- Plate movement
	- The movement of tectonic plates relative to each other. This results in the formation of landforms and tectonic phenomena
- Internal structure of the Earth
	- The Earth has layered structure consisting of the core, mantle and crust
- Asthenosphere
	- The semi-solid upper mantle that lies below the lithosphere
- Plate boundaries
	- Where plates may move away from each other, move towards each other, or slide past each other
- Convection currents:
	- Currents of heat within the hot softened mantle below the crust, generated by the heat from the Earth's core which drive tectonic plate movements
- Slab-Pull Force:
	- Gravitational force that causes a denser oceanic plate to sink further into the mantle under its own weight
- Divergent plate boundaries
	- Where plates move away from each other
- **Convergent** plate boundaries
	- Where plates move towards each other
- Subduction
	- The process of an oceanic plate colliding and descending beneath another less dense tectonic plate

### Plate tectonic theory
The plate tectonic theory explains that the earth has a three layered structure:
- #### Mantle:
	- Upper Most mantle
	- Lower Mantle
- #### Core:
	- Outer (Molten) Core
	- Inner Core
- #### Crust:
	- Continental Crust
		- These make up land masses
	- Oceanic Crust
		- These make up the Seafloor and are much denser than continental plates
There are 2 "Spheres" in the Earth's structure:
- #### Lithosphere:
	- Crust
	- Uppermost Mantle
- #### Asthenosphere
	- Lies beneath the 
![Pasted image 20240927092252.png](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020240927092252.png)
The Lithosphere is broken up into huge pieces called tectonic plates. These tectonic plates are constantly moving. Plate movements result in formation of physical landforms
Examples:
- Mountains
- Volcanoes

| Layers | Position   | Temperature             | Thickness           |
| ------ | ---------- | ----------------------- | ------------------- |
| Core   | Innermost  | 4400ºC-6000ºC (Highest) | 3300km (Thickest)   |
| Mantle | In between | 1000ºC -3700ºC          | 2900km              |
| Crust  | Outermost  | Lowest                  | 6km-70km (Thinnest) |
These crusts make up the lithosphere, and there are 3 types of boundaries between these crusts
- **Convergent**
	- Plates are moving towards each other
- Divergent
	- Plates are moving away from each other
- Tranform (Not Tested)
	- Plates are sliding past each other
There are two forces responsible for plate movements:
- [[Geography Notes#Convection Currents\|#Convection Currents]]
- [[Geography Notes#Slab-Pull Force\|#Slab-Pull Force]]

### Convection Currents
(Basically your physics convection currents)
1.  Heat from the Earth's core causes the mantle material to become less dense
2. Mantle material rises towards the surface
3. The rising mantle material then spreads the beneath the plates and drags them apart, causing divergent plate movement
4. The mantle material then loses heat and sinks towards the core
5. **Convergent** plate movement occurs where the convection currents collide
6. The materials then get heated up again and the process repeats.

### Slab-Pull force
When two plates converge, the denser oceanic crust is pulled down by gravity
It subducts beneath the lesser dense crust
The denser oceanic crust sinks deeper into the mantle under its own weight, pulling the rest of the plate with it, contributing to further convergence

## 1.4 Tectonic processes at different plate boundaries
### Divergent Boundaries

Tectonic plates are moving away from each other, resulting in [[Geography Notes#Volcanoes\|#Volcanoes]] and [[Geography Notes#Rift systems\|#Rift systems]]

#### Rift systems:
(Aka Rift valleys but wtv)
Happens at **Divergent Boundaries**
![Pasted image 20240927101109.png](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020240927101109.png)
1. Two tectonic plates move apart. As they diverge, the Earth's crust begins to thin and stretch.
	- In the case of a rift valley, this usually happens between two continental plates.
2. The decrease in overlying pressure causes parts of the underlying mantle to melt, forming magma (Not Lava, magma is lava when its still in the crust. Once its out of the crust, its called lava)
	- As the crust thins, the reduced pressure on the mantle below may cause partial melting, producing magma.
3. Magma rises through weak areas in the crust but often doesn’t reach the surface immediately
	- The stretching creates faults and cracks in the crust. As the plates pull apart, large blocks of the crust may sink between parallel faults, forming a deep, elongated valley known as a rift valley.

### **Convergent** Plate boundary
Tectonic plates moving towards each other leading to Fold mountains, Volcanoes and Oceanic trenches.
There are 3 types of **Convergent** plate boundaries;
- [[Geography Notes#Oceanic-Oceanic Plate boundary\|#Oceanic-Oceanic Plate boundary]]
- [[Geography Notes#Oceanic-Continental Plate boundary\|#Oceanic-Continental Plate boundary]]
- [[Geography Notes#Continental-Continental Plate boundary\|#Continental-Continental Plate boundary]]

#### Oceanic-Oceanic Plate boundary
![Screenshot 2024-09-27 at 10.29.00 AM.png](/img/user/Screenshot%202024-09-27%20at%2010.29.00%20AM.png)
1. Two oceanic crusts collide
2. The denser oceanic crusts subducts beneath the other
3. A deep depression forms at the edge of the upper crust, known as an Oceanic Trench
4. When the crusts sinks into the mantle, the high pressures forces the water out of the oceanic crust. Water acts as a volatile material lowering the melting point of the crust and allowing it to get melted into magma 
5. The increased volume of magma causes an increase of pressure and causes weaknesses on the surface of the Earth. The magma then rises to the surface through cracks in the Earth's surface. 
6. The lava (cuz its out of the Earth's surface) hardens forming volcanic rocks. These forms: 
	- a chain of volcanoes called a **volcano island**
	- Oceanic Trenches

#### Oceanic-Continental Plate boundary
![Screenshot 2024-09-27 at 10.47.53 AM.png](/img/user/Screenshot%202024-09-27%20at%2010.47.53%20AM.png)
	1. An oceanic plate collides with a continental plate
	2. The denser oceanic plate subducts beneath the continental plate
	3. This forms an oceanic trench in the subduction zone
	4. This forms an oceanic crust. Water lowers the melting point of the overlying mantle, causing it to melt, forming magma
	5. Magma rises through weak areas in the crust to the Earth's surface, forming volcanoes on the continental plate
	6. 
		- Friction along the subduction oceanic plate causes earthquake to occur
Enormous pressure of this plate boundary causes rocks on the continental plate to be uplifted and buckled, forming fold mountains.
Example:
- Oceanic Nazca plate converges with the continental south American Plate
- Denser Nazca Plate subducts beneath the SA Plate forming:
	- The Peru-Chile trench
	- The Andes fold Mountain range
	- The Nevado del Ruiz volcano
- Earthquakes are also common here, such as the 2010 Chile earthquake

#### Continental-Continental Plate boundary
![Screenshot 2024-09-27 at 10.55.28 AM.png](/img/user/Screenshot%202024-09-27%20at%2010.55.28%20AM.png)
1. Two Continental Plates collide
2. Subduction **Does Not** take place because continental plates are too **Buoyant** to subduct
3. Enormous pressure causes the rocks to be uplifted and buckled to form fold mountains

\*\Earthquakes are present at every convergent plate boundary, and are caused by the friction of the plates rubbing against each other

# Earthquakes and Volcanoes
## 2.2 Tectonic processes affecting the magnitude of volcanic eruptions
### Key Points:
- A volcanic Eruption occurs 
	- When less dense magma, which contains dissolved gases, forces its way upwards and breaks through weak areas in the Earth's crust
- The magnitude of volcanic eruption:
	- Determined by how easily dissolved gases can escape from the magma
	- Varies according to the type of volcano
		- Shield Volcanoes generally emit lava gently
		- Stratovolcanoes generally erupt more violently
- Volcanic eruptions are measured using the Volcanic Explosivity Index
	- Measures relative explosivity of historic and recent eruptions
	- Considers the volume of ejected materials, height of eruption cloud and duration of eruption
### Content Concept 
- Lava
	- Molten rocks that have erupted onto the Earth's surface; it is called magma when found below the Earth's surface
-  Crater
	- Bowl shaped depression at the top of a volcano 
- Active Vent
	- A hole at the bottom of the crater through which lava erupts
- Conduit 
	- A central passageway in the volcano through which magma flows through it connects the magma chamber to the vent
- Volcanic Cone
	- The triangle shaped hill or mountain at the top of a volcano formed from lava accumulating around the vent
- Magma Chamber
	- Location inside the volcano where magma is stored
- Viscous (Viscosity)
	- Thickness, Consistency, Stickiness
- Effusive
	- A relatively gentle eruption that is mainly dominated by lava outpour onto the lava
- Tephra
	- Any type or size of rock forcibly ejected/erupted out of the volcano and travels an airborne path during an eruption
	- Ash, volcanic rock, volcanic bombs 🤨
### Volcanic Eruptions
![Pasted image 20240927230418.png](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020240927230418.png)
A volcanic landform is created by lava erupted above the Earth's crust and accumulating over time in a conic shape.
These landforms occur at only divergent and convergent plate boundaries
